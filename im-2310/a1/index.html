    <h2>Week 2 Questions</h2>
<section id="week2" class="section-box">
    <section>
        <div><h3>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</div>
        <div><p>The first item that I paid attention to was the <em>psychedelic</em> trip effect that the liquid gives as the settings seem to be set to display maximal hallucinative effects on the liquid. Alongside the visual effect, the distorted audio was also noticed instantly.</p></div>
        <div><h3>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3></div>
        <div><p><li> Raising the mouse size/vibrato rate to a lower size </li>
                <li>Raising the speed/vibrato amount with the smaller mouse size</li>
                <li>Listening to the soundscape change with each move</li>
                <li>Swirling the cursor in different directions</li>
                <li>Understanding that cursor height on the screen represents tone</li>
                <li>Moving up and down accordingly</li>
                <li>Upping the worm effect to maximum</li>
                <li>Overwhelmed at the result, reset the parameters</li>
            </p></div>
        <div><h3>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3></div>
        <div><p>I spent the most time engaging in the interactive movement of the liquid, testing the different settings to determine which settings created the most satisfying distorting effects.</p></div>
        <div><h3>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3></div>
        <div><p>Swirling my mouse in circles whilst adjusting the speed/vibrato setting as it really magnetised the liquid effect to the next level upon each adjustment.</p></div>
        <div><h3>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3></div>
        <div><p>The primary goal of this interactive experience seems to be an interactive visualiser that pairs with a synthesiser of some sort. The goal may be to visualise what the artist feels and pictures as they use this synthesiser. If this is the case, it is quite successful at achieving its goal. </p></div>
        <div><h3>6) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3></div>
        <div><p>I believe it communicates its primary goal well as the controls are easily understood and the interactive visualiser is adjustable instantly and the audio is also applied upon loading up too, allowing for maximal clarity as to what steps you should take. </p></div>
        <div><h3>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3></div>
        <div><p>You could interact with this experience many different times as you obtain a new sound each time you adjust a setting or move your cursor. This allows for less chances to be turned off from the site due to boredom or hearing repetitive sounds constantly.</p></div>
        <div><h3>8) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3></div>
        <div><p>Through the use of the controls sliders, the site prompts the user to change settings as the control panel is not hidden unless the user hides it themselves. This panel being positioned there upon arrival prompts the user to adjust any slider they wish. If this panel was hidden on arrival the user may think that it is just a visual piece until they notice the button, or if the panel was to disappear after one change, the user may think they have fixed it or completed a mission of some kind. </p></div> </section>

    <h2>Week 3 Questions</h2>
    <section id="week3" class="section-box">
        <div><h3>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3> </div>
        <div><p>Liquid Entropy seems to reference a synthesiser by utilising manual sliders and manipulation to edit the sound that is originally found on arrival to the site. The manipulation being the movement of the cursor combined with the different control settings.</p></div>
        <div><h3>10) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h3> </div>
        <div><p>This reference suggests to me that I should try to obtain both the best sounding and visually pleasing result possible. After extensive testing and trialling, I determined my favourite audiovisual experience occurred with the settings shown below.</p></div>

        <div><h3>11) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h3></div>
        <div><p> The idea of the reference allowed me to focus on actually creating an audiovisual product I enjoyed from the experience, rather than simply just playing around and leaving.</p></div>
        <div><h3>12) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h3> </div>
        <div><p> The most frustrating element of the experience is when the mouse is downsized to 0.125, as the effects are not very visually pleasing due to the trails and wave effects being much smaller</p></div>
        <div><h3>13) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h3> </div>
        <div><p>The most satisfying element of the experience is when the zoom/turbo slider is at 1.00 as the sound is reminiscent of the grand, heavily synthetic opening sequences of older films.</p></div>
