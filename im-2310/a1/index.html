    <h2>Week 2 Questions</h2>
<section id="week2" class="section-box">
    <section>
        <div><h3>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</div>
        <div><p>The first item that I paid attention to was the psychedelic trip effect that the liquid gives as the settings seem to be set to display maximal hallucinative effects on the liquid. Alongside the visual effect, the distorted audio was also noticed instantly.</p></div>
        <div><h3>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3></div>
        <div><p>My answer</p></div>
        <div><h3>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3></div>
        <div><p>I spent the most time engaging in the interactive movement of the liquid, testing the different settings to determine which settings created the most satisfying distorting effects.</p></div>
        <div><h3>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3></div>
        <div><p>Swirling my mouse in circles whilst adjusting the speed/vibrato setting as it really magnetised the liquid effect to the next level upon each adjustment.</p></div>
        <div><h3>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3></div>
        <div><p>The primary goal of this interactive experience seems to be an interactive visualiser that pairs with a synthesiser of some sort. The goal may be to visualise what the artist feels and pictures as they use this synthesiser. If this is the case, it is quite successful at achieving its goal. </p></div>
        <div><h3>6) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3></div>
        <div><p>I believe it communicates its primary goal well as the controls are easily understood and the interactive visualiser is adjustable instantly and the audio is also applied upon loading up too, allowing for maximal clarity as to what steps you should take. </p></div>
        <div><h3>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3></div>
        <div><p>You could interact with this experience many different times as you obtain a new sound each time you adjust a setting or move your cursor. This allows for less chances to be turned off from the site due to boredom or hearing repetitive sounds constantly.</p></div>
        <div><h3>8) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3></div>
        <div><p>Through the use of the controls sliders, the site prompts the user to change settings as the control panel is not hidden unless the user hides it themselves. This panel being positioned there upon arrival prompts the user to adjust any slider they wish. If this panel was hidden on arrival the user may think that it is just a visual piece until they notice the button, or if the panel was to disappear after one change, the user may think they have fixed it or completed a mission of some kind. </p></div> </section>
