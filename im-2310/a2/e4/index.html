        <!--For this media player I decided to implement a full screen button to toggle between the medium size player and full screen mode. 
        I believe this is essential to any media player as it obviously allows those who wish to fully immerse themselves into the video 
        experience and allows those who struggle with any kind of vision impairments to have a chance at watching the video in higher detail.
      
      I believe that a full screen button is most important commpared to a next video button or loop as in my experience, I have gone full 
      screen mode on a majority of YouTube videos I have watched, but only looped or used a rewind button a handful of times.-->
