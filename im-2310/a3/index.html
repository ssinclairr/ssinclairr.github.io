                <h2>Rider - Brown Leather Strap</h2>
                <p>The foundation of this page stems from the idea that artists, particularly those who sell their art, hate the idea of parting ways with their work as they have grown attached to it. I have experienced this first hand most recently whilst presenting various projects that have felt very personal to me, due to the significant time spent conceptualising and developing, alongside and personal touches I put into the work. This feeling almost makes you want to keep everything for your own enjoyment. To put a light hearted spin on this concept, I have developed an incredibly annoying and broken interaction in HTML and CSS.

                <h2>Emporio Armarni - Silver Face</h2>
               
                <p>In this work I decided to create a webstore that fails to allow the user to purchase any of the products. Through the use of HTML and CSS, the page layout was constructed and styled.  

                    To create this interaction, I have uploaded 6 different products which all have an ‘Add to Cart’ button underneath, and when clicked or hovered the button will change in some way to make trying to purchase an item as difficult as possible. 
                    
                </p>
                <h3>$460</h3>
                <button class="button2">Add To Cart</button>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="product3">
                <img src="img/watch3.jpg" alt="watch3">
                <h2>Emporio Armarni - White Face</h2>
                <p> The first interaction hides the button upon hover and displays a cursor depicting a non-accessible item. <br>
                    
                    The second interaction allows the user to click the button but conversely, scales the button to a ridiculous size. <br>

                    The third interaction is toying with the user as the button ‘runs away’ from the cursor on hover and clicking. <br>
                    
                    The fourth button interaction displays the button swiftly falling away upon hover. <br>
                    
                    The fifth interaction includes the button changing colours and prompting a fake loading cursor that will never actually load. <br>
                    
                    The sixth and final interaction removes the product from the page completely, whilst hovering over any area on the product.

                <h2>Casio Edifice</h2>
                <p>In designing the layout for this web store, I decided to purposefully create a basic, stereotypical web store with just product images, product name and description. This was to shift the user’s expectations away from a perfect and easy-to-use design to a simple layout supported by the infuriating interaction they have with items on this page. 
                </p>
                <h3>$380</h3>
                <button class="button4">Add To Cart</button>

                <h2>Adam Kimmel</h2>
                <p>The colour palette for this store is purposefully grayscale, utilising black white and grey to create a simple feel to the store. After researching different watch brands and interacting with their websites, it was determined that this simple black, white and grey colour palette is used to create a sense of a clean and professional store, so I decided to implement this style, to contrast with how unprofessional it really is. This palette also allows the images of the products to be the focus of the page, leading the user to attempt to purchase any of the items.

                <h2>Maurice de Mauriac Zurich</h2>
                <p>Overall this webpage aimed to irritate the user whilst interacting and deter them from purchasing any of the products through the elusive, disappearing and deceiving buttons. </p>
