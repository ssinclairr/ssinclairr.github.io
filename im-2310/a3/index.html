                <h2>Rider - Brown Leather Strap</h2>
                <p>The foundation of this page stems from the idea that artists, particularly those 
                    who sell their art, hate the idea of parting ways with their work as they have 
                    grown attached to it. I have experienced this first hand most recently whilst 
                    presenting various projects that have felt very personal to me, due to the 
                    significant time spent conceptualising and developing, alongside and personal 
                    touches I put into the work. This feeling almost makes you want to keep everything 
                    for your own enjoyment. To put a light hearted spin on this concept, I have 
                    developed an incredibly annoying and broken interaction in HTML and CSS.

                <p>In this work I decided to create a webstore that fails to allow the 
                        user to purchase any of the products.<br>
    
                        To create this interaction, I have uploaded 6 different products 
                        which all have an ‘Add to Cart’ button underneath, and when clicked 
                        or hovered the button will change in some way to make trying to 
                        purchase an item as difficult as possible.
                </p>
                <h3>$460</h3>
                <button class="button2">Add To Cart</button>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="product3">
                <img src="img/watch3.jpg" alt="watch3">
                <h2>Emporio Armarni - White Face</h2>
                <p> The first interaction hides the button upon hover and displays a cursor depicting a non-accessible item. <br>
                    
                    The second interaction allows the user to click the button but conversely, scales the button to a ridiculous size. <br>

                    The third interaction is toying with the user as the button ‘runs away’ from the cursor on hover and clicking. <br>
                    
                    The fourth button interaction displays the button swiftly falling away upon hover. <br>
                    
                    The fifth interaction includes the button changing colours and prompting a fake loading cursor that will never actually load. <br>
                    
                    The sixth and final interaction removes the product from the page completely, whilst hovering over any area on the product.
